| September 11 | 12:48 - 1:18pm  |                                                                                                     At first, I started thinking about just building every available highway, and give each group of cities that forms based on the available highways a single hospital. Soon after, I realized that a lot of the available would be unnecessary and would increase the cost. But I think I had a decent idea: To put all the cities into large groups, and give each group a hospital. |
| September 11 |  1:18 - 1:55pm  |                                                                                         Now in terms of creating an algorithm to find and create these groups of cities, I got stumped. I was trying to think of it like graph theory because of the city nodes and highway edges, so in essence, what I _think_ I have to do is to find a way to get the largest connected groups-- this will help me lower costs because I will only have to put one hospital in each of those groups. |
| September 11 |  9:00 - 9:30pm  |                                                                                                                    Now, I started thinking about iterating through the array of possible highways, and thinking of conditions that each highway would have to pass in order to be built. Since I couldn't think of any conditions off the bat, I started thinking about using BFS to connect all of the nodes in the city with the least amount of moves (bridges), making it cost less. |
| September 14 | 10:40 - 11:10pm |      I knew that the conditions for a highway to be built would have to go along the lines of connecting the most nodes. I though that this could create the largest clusters, resulting in the least amount of highways needed to be built. That's when I started to realize that this way of doing it would result in a really large runtime because you need to iterate through every single node to find the biggest, and then do that all over again until there are no more nodes. |
| September 14 | 11:10 - 11:40pm | Finally, I thought more about how I could more efficiently get the largest clusters possible. I kept coming back to how the thought of starting the process. It was easy to think about it visually, that if a node can connect two large clusters to create one big cluster, you should build that highway, but I just couldn't think of how to do that in code. Going back to what I said earlier about starting, I don't know where I should start when there are no clusters around. |
| September 21 | 9:30 - 10:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I first started by looking at the pseudocode for the path compression, and translating that into my own code. However, I was having a hard time understanding it and trying to implement it. I ran into numerous bugs and infinite loops, and it was not good. |
| September 21 | 10:00 - 10:30pm |                                                                                                                                                                                       So, I went back to the basics and coded up the simple version of union-find to get a better start. Thankfully, it worked first time, so I looked back at the path compression pseudocode and finally understood it :) Slowly, I started implementing each part of path compression, and it worked! |
| September 21 | 10:30 - 11:00pm |                                            Then, I looked at the pseudocode for weight balancing, and tried to implement that. However, while trying to do that, I realized that I wanted to restart, but I had completely messed up all of my code. So, I deleted everything that I had, and recoded my path compression algorithm and made sure that worked. Here, I also finally decided to commit my path compression code because I would be able to retrieve that if needed again. |
| September 21 | 11:30 - 12:00pm |                                                                                                              After looking back at my path compression code and the weight balancing slides, I finally understood that I was counting the order of each subtree incorrectly. I realized that I needed to actually increase the number of nodes by one for each subgraph because every node is initialized as 0, not negative 1, which broke everything. So, I fixed that, and it worked! |
